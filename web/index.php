					<p>My name is Ryan Hafen. I am working on my BS in Web Design and Development emphasis in Development. I chose this major because it very similar to what I have been doing 
					professionally for about ten years. I am a Financial Data and Applications analyst, which means that I create and maintain database for a health insurance company in the 
					Finance department. Along with the database aspect, I create reporting applications and dashboards. The bulk of my experience is with SQL Server stack (SSMS, SSRS, SSIS, and 
					SSAS) along with other SQL syntaxes (MySQL, PL/SQL, etc.). I have a lot of VBA experience created Access and Excel application and reports. In my current role, we are starting 
					to migrate our SSRS reports to web based, so I have been in a hand full of trainings for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and ASP.NET (MVC). In this course, I am hoping to expand 
					on the things that I learned in my previous trainings, as ASP.NET and Visual Studios is the language that my company has chosen to build our web applications.</p>
					<p>Here are a few things about me, I live in Lincoln, CA, a suburb of Sacramento. I been here for just over three years. I’m originally from the Ogden, Utah area. I have an amazing 
					wife of two years, two wonderful step daughters, age 10 and 12, and 19-month-old baby boy. I served a mission to the Ecuador Guayaquil North Mission between 2000 and 2002. </p>
